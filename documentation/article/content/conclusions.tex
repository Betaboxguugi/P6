\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sect:conc}

In this paper we presented \FW{}, an ETL test-framework for use in conjunction with pygrametl. We started off by looking into the field of ETL testing. It was found that most other test frameworks either were not specialized in ETL testing, or they were GUI based. As pygrametl is API based, so there would be a clash in usage philosophy, when using a GUI. By looking deeper into the goals of ETL testing, we found that its main purpose is to ensure correct flow of data from sources to the DW. As this is a rather data-centric problem, we base \FW{} upon source-to-target testing. Here testing of an ETL occurs by focusing on the DW that it populates. 

\FW{} supports automatic testing at the system level, and assists in both functional- and regression testing. It consists of two larger components, the DWPopulator and the Predicates. The DWPopulator allows for the execution of pygrametl programs, so that a DW may be populated for test. It also allows testers to dynamically replace sources and DW in the pygrametl program’s source code with test data. The Predicates contain the actual test functionality. There are different types of predicates, each allowing for the implementation of a common assertion on the DW’s contents. Once a tester has set up all their predicates, they are executed. It is then reported on, whether their assertions hold. 

Having developed \FW{}, we evaluated its use as compared to manual testing through SQL queries. We found no remarkable decrease in execution speed when using \FW{}, but less statements were needed for the actual test implementation. This a benefit for manual testers in migrating to \FW{}. Yet, we must remember that our predicates can only be used to cover a portion of an ETL system. It is likely that there are situations during testing, where the flexibility of a SQL query could come in handy. However, we determine that \FW{} can be used to cover the most common cases during testing.

If more work was to be done on \FW{}, some functionality could be added. There is a restriction upon the types of programs,  which the DWPopulator can dynamically replace sources and DW. Thus, an upgrade to this component should allow for more types of programs to be processed. More predicate types could be added to the framework in order to handle more specialized assertions. It would also be beneficial to implement feature that allow testers to develop their own predicate types.
