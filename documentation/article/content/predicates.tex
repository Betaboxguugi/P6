\section{Predicates}\label{sect:pred}
This section will describe each of the predicate classes found in \FW. These are used to assert specific properties of a DW during test. Each subsection will describe the purpose of a predicate, how it is instantiated and how it functions. Each predicate is related to \cref{fig:exdw} as to show, how it may be used in practice. In the implementations we have tried to use as much SQL as possible, where it made sense to do so. Retrieving information directly is much faster than treating representation objects within Python. One complication with this approach is that different DBMS' usable
with \FW{} use different implementations of SQL, and we risk damaging the compatibility of \FW{} by using SQL. With that in mind we have been careful with the SQL commands our queries use.

For instantiation of different predicate types some common parameters are used. These are presented here, as not to repeat the information later.
\begin{description}
\item [table\_name] a string with the name of a table from the DW. Using the get\_data\_representation method from DWRepresentation, this is used to fetch the corresponding table.
\item [column\_names] a string or list indicating one or more attributes from the table. If the attribute is None, we fetch all attributes for each row. If not, the data fetched depends on column\_names\_exclude.
\item [column\_names\_exclude] a boolean that indicates, how to fetch data using column\_names, when iterating over the table. We iterate using the itercolumns method from TableRepresentation. If the boolean is false, we only fetch the subset of attributes from column\_names for each row. If true, we fetch all attributes not appearing in column\_names.
