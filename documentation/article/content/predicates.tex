\section{Predicates}
This section will describe each of the predicates found in \FW. Each predicate will be presented with an introduction of its purpose, a small code example and what each of the arguments are used. This is then finally followed by an more in depth description of how it functions.

\subsection{Commonly used arguments in the predicates}
In our predicates, some arguments repeat in their name and use. To avoid repetition we will go through each of them here. If any of these arguments has additional functionality than stated here,
