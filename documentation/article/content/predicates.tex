\section{Predicates}\label{sect:pred}
This section will describe each of the predicate classes found in \FW. These are used to assert specific properties of a DW during test. Each subsection will describe the purpose of a predicate, how it is instantiated and how it functions. Each predicate is related to \Cref{fig:exdw} as to show, how it may be used in practice. In the implementations we have tried to use as much SQL as possible, where it made sense to do so. Working with data close to the database is much faster than treating representation objects within Python. One complication with this approach is that different DBMS' usable
with \FW{} use different implementations of SQL. Thus we risk damaging the compatibility of \FW{} by using SQL. With this in mind, we restrict the predicates to use only the most standard SQL functionality. The SQL queries in question are dynamically generated by the predicates, depending on how they are instantiated. Across the predicates these queries often return all rows found to be faulty according to the assertion. If no rows are returned, a successful assertion is reported. If rows are returned, a failed assertion is reported along with the faulty rows. In general, more in-depth reporting upon predicates only occurs, when they fail.   

For instantiation of different predicate types some common parameters are used. These are presented here, as not to repeat the information later.
\begin{description}
\item [table\_name] a string with the name of a table from the DW. Using the get\_data\_representation method from DWRepresentation, this is used to fetch the corresponding table.Can also be given as a list of strings, if a natural join of tables is wanted insead.
\item [column\_names] a string or list indicating one or more attributes from the table. If the attribute is None, we fetch all attributes for each row. If not, the data fetched depends on column\_names\_exclude.
\item [column\_names\_exclude] a boolean that indicates, which attributes to work on. If false, we use the attributes as described in column\_names. If true we use all attributes not in column\_names. Default is false.
