\section{Predicates}
This section will describe each of the predicates found in \FW. Each predicate will be presented with an introduction of its purpose, a small code example and what each of the arguments are used. This is then finally followed by an more in depth description of how the predicate function.

\subsection{Commonly used arguments in the predicates}
In our predicates, some arguments repeat in their name and use. To avoid repetition, each of these arguments are presented and explained here.

\begin{description}
\item [table\_name] a string containing the name of a table from the DW, specifying which table the predicate will run on.
\item [column\_names] a list of strings or a string containing the name(s) of the column(s), which specifies which column(s) the predicate will test against within the table. If column\_names\_exclude is also an argument for the predicate, then the default value for column\_names is null, which has some interaction with column\_names\_exclude.
\item [column\_names\_exclude] a bool, if true, then columns\_names specifies which columns the predicate will exclude to look at when comparing. Default is False. Note that if columns\_names is Null and column\_names\_exclude is false, then the predicate will set column\_names\_exclude to true. This feature enables the user to just write the table as the only argument, the predicate will then test all columns of the specified table.
