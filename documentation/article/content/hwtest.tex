\section{Overview of \FW{}}
In this section we will give a quick overview of \FW{}. The framework is developed to assist in performing source to target testing of pygrametl programs. It is designed for functional testing at the system level, and supports regression testing. The framework is not made for exhausitve testing, but rather to assist in reaching an adequate test coverage. It assists in testing for both data loss and conformity to business rules.

\FW{} consists of two major components

As \FW{} performs source to targets tests, it is important that users are able to express assertions about a DW. What assertions a user need to make, depends on what needs to be tested. We limit the framework to focus on testing the contents of a DW. The framework supplies some classes, known as predicates, which represents some data-centric assertion types. These are used to make the needed assertions for tests. In defining what assertions the framework needed to supply, we looked into some common data data-centric concerns. These include both data loss and whether business rules and data integrity are upheld.  These will be explained in the following sections:
