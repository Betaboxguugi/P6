\subsection{FunctionalDependencyPredicate}
FunctionalDependencyPredicate asserts that a table, or natural join of tables, holds a certain functional dependency. This can prove useful to check if a DW holds certain hierarchical properties i.a. FunctionalDependencyPredicate is instantiated as follows, with a description of its parameters below.

\insertcodefile{FunctionalDependencyPredicate.py}{Instantiation of FunctionalDependencyPredicate}

\begin{description}
\item [tables] a list of table names, that will get a natural join between them. Of which the result is what the predicate runs on. 
\item [attributes] attributes which are depended upon by other attributes. Given as either a single attribute name, or a tuple of attribute names.
\item [dependent\_attributes] attributes which are functionally dependent on the former attributes. Given as either a single attribute name, or a tuple of attribute names.

For example with the attributes \texttt{('a', 'b')} and the dependent attribute \texttt{'c'} we get the functional dependency: $a,\ b \rightarrow c$.
\end{description}

In our instantiation above, we use the predicate to assert that there is a functional dependency between a book's title and its author. If this assertion holds, it means that no book is written by more than one author. 

Below in \cref{SQLExample.sql} is an example of the query used in the predicate to find rows that are not in compliance with the functional dependency. Given the instantiation above, the FunctionalDependencyPredicate will create this query.
