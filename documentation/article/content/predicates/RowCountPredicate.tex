\subsection{RowCountPredicate}
RowCountPredicate asserts if a table has the specified number of rows. This can be useful in situations where the user knows how many rows should be in a given table, after a function or transformation has been done upon it. RowCountPredicate is instantiated as follows, with description of the parameters below.

\insertcodefile{RowCountPredicate.py}{Instantiation of RowCountPredicate}

\begin{description}
\item [number\_of\_rows] a integer representing the specified number of rows we are looking for
\end{description}

In our instantiation above, we assert that CountryDim has 200 entries.  

RowCountPredicate iterates over each row in a table, counting them and adding them to a list. The length of the list is then compared to number provided by number\_of\_rows. If equal, the test is successful, if not equal, the test return false and reports, how many rows are actually in the table.
