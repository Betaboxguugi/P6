\subsection{RowCountPredicate}
RowCountPredicate asserts if a table has the specified number of rows. This can be useful in situations where the user knows how many rows should be in a given table, after a function or transformation has been done upon it. RowCountPredicate is instantiated as follows, with description of the parameters below.

\insertcodefile{RowCountPredicate.py}{Instantiation of RowCountPredicate}

\begin{description}
\item [number\_of\_rows] a integer representing the specified number of rows we are looking for
\end{description}

In our instantiation above, we assert that CountryDim has 200 entries.  
RowCountPredicate would then in this instance issue the following SQL query, which counts how many rows are in a given table.

\insertcodefileSQL{SQLRowCountPredicate.sql}{}

RowCountPredicate will then compare the result from this query to the specified number of rows we are looking for, in this case 200. If equal, the test is successful, if not equal, the test return false and reports how many rows are actually in the table.
