\insertcodefile{ColumnNotNullPredicate.py}{Instantiation of ColumnNotNullPredicate}

ColumnNotNullPredicate iterates over every row in the specified table. In each row it then iterates over each element in the column(s) specified. Through this later iteration it insures that each element is not null. If a null is found, its row is appended to a list, which is displayed as part of the report object, which also will report the result of the test, as false.
