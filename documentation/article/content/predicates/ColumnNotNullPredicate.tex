\subsection{ColumnNotNullPredicate}
For a set of specified columns within a table, ColumnNotNullPredicate lets testers assert that no member of the given columns are null. While nulls may be allowed to occur within a table, they could indicate data loss. It may also be the case that not null constraints are placed upon certain columns. This is the case for primary keys. The ColumnNotNullPredicate is instantiated as exemplified below:

\insertcodefile{ColumnNotNullPredicate.py}{Instantiation of ColumnNotNullPredicate}

ColumnNotNullPredicate functions by iterating over every row in the specified table. For each row it checks, whether any of its specified column attributes have the value null. If this is the case, the assertion is broken. As we iterate, we store all offending rows, so that they may be reported to the tester.
