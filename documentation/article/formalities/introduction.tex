To make sure that a piece of software can be expected to run at low risk of failure, it must be tested. Today we have specialized software that assist in the automatic execution of tests. This allows testers to focus more on what to test and less on test implementation. Conceptually this should lead to tests of a higher quality.

Some testing tools such as JUnit have a broad application, while other test frameworks have a more specific use. Per extension, there exists many tools exclusively used for testing Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) systems. These systems support the creation and update of data warehouses (DW), which are mainly used for business analysis. An ETL process will extract data from a set of sources, apply transformations to that data and then load it into a DW. Often GUI-based tools are used, when developing ETL systems. The pygrametl python package is open source, and it allows for coding ETL systems instead. The idea being that experts perform better when using an API rather than a GUI \cite{thomsen2009pygrametl}. Our goal for this article is to develop a testing framework, which may assist users of pygrametl in testing their ETL systems.

ETL testing may be set up manually using SQL. Yet, in the current market many different testing tools exists. These allow for the automation of tests. Testing often occurs by focusing on the DW, which the ETL system populates. QuerySurge\cite{QuerySurge} is one such testing tool. It focuses on comparing the data from sources to the data in the DW. The tool is build on the idea that data is often unaltered, as it passes through the ETL process. This means that column A in a source may be one-to-one mappable to column B in the DW. Testing of this type only requires the user to supply some simple mappings between sources and DW. As such, QuerySurge presents itself as novice-friendly and allows for testing through a GUI. Yet, if mappings between source data and DW become more complex, testers will need to write up some SQL code. We determine that this kind of tool is not fitting for the users of pygrametl. As pygrametl users are experts, they will not gain anything from the novice-friendly features of QuerySurge. The amount of code needed for testing may also be rather large, if there is a frequent need for writing SQL.

Testing may also occur through the comparison of tables within a populated DW to those defined by the user. By writing up a table, testers assert, how they expect a DW table to look after load. The truth value of this assertion can be found by comparing to the actual DW table. For this, tools such as AnyDBTest\cite{AnyDbTest} may be used. AnyDBTest also allows testers to describe, what kind of comparison should be made. For example, we may test that one table is the subset of another. Our issue with this type of testing requires the setup of many user-defined tables. Again a large amount of test code needs to be written. We do however believe that table comparison is a powerful tool for ETL testing. Yet, comparison between tables should not be the only assertable property of a DW.

Having looked at some of the currently available tools, we find that they require a lot of test code to be written. To get a wider test coverage, we need to decrease the amount of code necessary for each test. We also fear that faults may be more likely to occur in the test code, as it grows larger. Such faults can undermine the usefulness and accuracy of test results.

To allow for automated testing of pygrametl programs, we have developed \FW{}. Like AnyDBTest it is assertion-based. However, it does not only allow for assertions to be made upon the relationships of tables. Assertions may relate to other DW properties such as data integrity. The framework allows for functional testing at the system level, once all components of the ETL have been integrated. As the framework automates test execution, it can also be used for regression testing. We aim to help testers in writing less code for a single test. This should lead to less time spend on each test, enabling a wider coverage during testing. Covering more of the software should increase its overall quality. We also need for the tests to be executed at a reasonable speed. If the tests are quick to write, but slow to execute, users may fall back on other tools or perform testing manually.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will give a brief overview of some related literature. This is followed by an introduction to the pygrametl python package in section 3. Section 4 will explain some basic testing terminology relevant to the paper. This leads into an overview of \FW{} in section 5, followed by some sections describing its implementation. Section 6 shows how the framework allows for dynamic replacement of sources and DW in a pygrametl program.  In section 7 we describe the classes used to represent the DW during testing. Afterwards, section 8 explains the different types of predicates, used to assert properties of a DW. After implementation section 9 shows off the use of \FW{}. This is followed by an evaluation of the framework's ability to reduce test code. Finally, in section 10 we conclude upon the framework.
