\Abstract{The python package pygrametl allows developers to construct ETL systems through an API. We develop a testing framework, \FW{}, which allows testers to evaluate programs developed using pygrametl. The framework is developed for both functional- and regression testing at the system level. It is based on source to target testing. Here an ETL system is tested by asserting about properties of the DW, which it populates. \FW{} can be used to check whether assertions are upheld by such a DW. These assertions are implemented using \FW{}â€™s predicate classes. These allow testers to assert about DW properties relating to data loss and business rules. After development we evaluate \FW{} against manual testing, where testers write SQL to test for properties. We found that both methods result in test implementations with the same runtime. However, manual testing needed 110 statements for its implementation, where \FW{} only needed 11.}
